    <summary>Build queries for D365, CRM, XRM, CDS and the Power Platform. Investigate data. Get code. Empower yourself to achieve more.</summary>
    <description>
FetchXML Builder is used to create queries against CDS databases.
CDS includes technologies we know as:
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement
- Dynamics CRM
- Common Data Service for Apps
- XRM
- PowerApps (Model Driven)
- PowerApps (Canvas connected to D365 or CDS)
- PowerBI (connected to D365 or CDS)
      
The tool will assist in three major areas:

1. Constructing queries, including more advanced features like:
- aggregates
- outer joins
- complex "not-in"-queries
- attributes from multi-level linked entities
- update existing views with altered queries

2. Querying CDS/CRM for information not (easily) found in the UI
- system / internal entities
- attributes hidden in CRM UI
- join on other fields than relationships

3. Developer assistance generating code for
- C# QueryExpression code
- WebAPI / OData query string
- Microsoft Flow List Records parameters
- SQL, JavaScript and C# stubs
- Easy to use UI to compose queries for reports in CRM

The tool reads metadata from CDS to assist with selecting entities, attributes, relations and to perform validation of condition values.

To make it even more appealing, there is also the possibility to have it show "Friendly names", which will replace the technical names of entities and attributes with their display names in the users' currently selected language, much like Advanced Find does.
