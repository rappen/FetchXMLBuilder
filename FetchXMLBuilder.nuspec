Build queries for Microsoft Dataflex, Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform. Investigate data. Get code. Empower yourself to achieve more.

FetchXML Builder is used to create and execute queries against Microsoft Dataflex and Dynamics 365/CRM data.
Dataflex and Dataflex Pro include technologies we know as:
- Microsoft Dynamics 365
- Dynamics CRM
- XRM
- Power Apps (Model Driven)
- Power Apps (Canvas connected to D365 or Dataflex)
- PowerBI (connected to D365 or Dataflex)
- Microsoft Teams apps
      
The tool will assist in three major areas:

1. Constructing queries, including more advanced features like:
- aggregates
- outer joins
- complex "not-in"-queries
- attributes from multi-level linked entities
- update existing views with altered queries

2. Querying Dataflex/CRM for information not (easily) found in the UI
- system / internal entities
- attributes hidden in CRM UI
- join on other fields than relationships

3. Developer assistance generating code for
- C# QueryExpression code
- WebAPI / OData query string
- Power Automate List Records
- SQL, JavaScript and C# stubs
- Easy to use UI to compose queries for reports in CRM

The tool reads metadata from Microsoft Dataflex and Dynamics 365 / CRM to assist with selecting entities, attributes, relations and to perform validation of condition values.

To make it even more appealing, there is also the possibility to have it show "Friendly names", which will replace the technical names of entities and attributes with their display names in the users' currently selected language, much like Advanced Find does.
