FetchXML Builder is used to create and execute queries against Microsoft Dataverse / Power Apps / Dynamics 365.
What you don't know about Dataverse this morning, you'll know this afternoon.
If you can't solve it, ask in the integrated AI Chat.

The tool will assist in three major areas:

1. Constructing queries, including more advanced features like:
- aggregates
- outer joins
- complex "not-in"-queries
- attributes from multi-level linked entities
- update existing views with altered queries

2. Querying CDS/CRM for information not (easily) found in the UI
- system / internal entities
- attributes hidden in CRM UI
- join on other fields than relationships

3. Developer assistance generating code for
- C# QueryExpression code
- WebAPI / OData query string
- Power Automate List Records
- SQL, JavaScript and C# stubs
- Easy to use UI to compose queries for reports in CRM

The tool reads metadata from Microsoft Dataverse and Dynamics 365 / CRM to assist with selecting entities, attributes, relations and to perform validation of condition values.

To make it even more appealing, there is also the possibility to have it show "Friendly names", which will replace the technical names of entities and attributes with their display names in the users' currently selected language, much like Advanced Find does.</description>
		<releaseNotes>Added a few improvements in the latest release, but most new things came out in version 1.2025.9.6.
Etherway - always get the latest! :)

FetchXML Builder AI Chat can now be used / tested by my Free Azure AI Foundry provider!
No personal account at OpenAI or Anthropic is required (although it is still possible to use one, of course).
Open the "AI Chat" tab and ask questions about your data, queries, or how to use the tool.

NOTE: 
This version of FetchXML Builder needs to have XrmToolBox in version 1.2025.7.* or later!
